Test Case Description
	The test cases for the Polygon class are under the assumption that the order
	of the points follow a counter-clockwise order, where the polygons are 
	formed by connecting the dots in a counter-clockwise fashion. 
	
	To test the Polygon class, a regular square with the points (0,0), (1,0), 
	(1,1), (0,1) would be used, with a point (1,2) being placed outside of the 
	square. The desired output for this polygon would be the points being 
	outputted to the console in counter-clockwise order, with the point given 
	shown to be outside of the square. 
	
	Another test case for the polygon is with an irregular polygon, with the 
	points (0,0), (1,0), (4,1), (3,2), (1,-1) would be used, with a point (1,1)
	being placed inside of the polygon. The desired output for this polygon 
	woudl be the poitns being outputted to the console in counter-clockwise 
	order, with the point given shown to be inside of the polygon. 
	
	To test the RegularOctagon class, a regular octagon is used with points 
	such as (0,0), (1,0), with an n value of 2. The desired output for the 
	octagon should be its points being outputted in a counter-clockwise fashion 
	and the appropriate points being affected by the multiplier of 2, such as 
	the two points provided becoming (0,0), (2,0).
